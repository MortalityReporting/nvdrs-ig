For identifiers without a clearly associated namespace (e.g. OIDs), a set of temporary namespaces has been laid out for use. Each
follows a pattern of "urn:vdrs:*:*", wherein the first * variable represents the specific system and the second the data element in question.

For example, "urn:vdrs:nvdrs:victimnumber" relates specifically to the NVDRS data schema and the victim number identifier element, providing a namespace for all values given.
